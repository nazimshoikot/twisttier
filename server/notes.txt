need to figure out how front end is going to know that a user is logged in
  so like if the browser closes and then they reopen it, how do we check that?
  well the server could send an ack header every time a transaction occurs, but
  that seems insecure. 
  could make a call to the server on the first boot? this would work, but it could be slow
    hmm actually i think this is a good way of doing this
    have a post for /confirmed or whatever arbitrary name we call it and then send 200 or 406
